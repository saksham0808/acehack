# Reveries of a programmer

I am a sophomore studying Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur; also known as IIT Kanpur. I'm a programmer and a Linux enthusiast.

I'm just an year-old into the serious programmer family, from someone who didn't even know Arrays on coming to college to, well.. someone coding up this whole website from scratch, from not knowing a bit about web development till March, to this, yes [my journey](/musings?aname=voyage) has been a fine one.

Being a code-from-scratch guy (perhaps it's partly because I'm lazy to read documentations), I love things like Shell Scripting, but that doesn't mean Python, Node.js, Scala and the likes don't get my love. I've explored a lot about the world of computers, and I'll be sharing new things I come across here in my blog.

### Some bits about me and my computing preferences:

I'm a fun loving, tall, lanky guy who codes 80% of the time of the day, mostly with classic rock playing on my headphones.

Apart from coding, I am into PC gaming, badminton and photography, though most of that has taken a back-seat.

**I <3 Linux, All of it**

Yes, I love Linux. Literally everything about it. I have installed Arch linux (my favorite, forever. Period.) around 15-20 times, in different scenarios, on different laptops, and thus have a well rounded experience. Not just install, I tend to customize it a lot, have a look at 'my-rc-files' repo on my git.

**The king of text editors (in my opinion): Vim**

Vim is my favorite (wait, not just favorite, ONLY) text editor. One vim for everything under the sun. My vimrc ([link to GitHub](https://github.com/saksham0808/my-rc-files/blob/master/.vimrc)) is quite a decent looking one too. Try giving it a look for some good ideas about how to get more productive with vim. I believe everyone would find something useful in there. New? Have a look here [Kickstart to Vim](/technical?aname=vim).

**Desktop Manager and ways to stay productive on Linux**

My favorite Desktop Window manager for Linux is i3wm, it's easy to customize once you get the hang of it, and tiling keeps my productivity at the peak at all times. If you haven't tried i3 before, I urge you to try it atleast once. Interested? Read more here [Hopping over to i3wm](/technical?aname=i3wm) and [Shifting away from GNOME](/technical?aname=leavegnome).
I also like the GNOME Desktop Environment, although it is heavy and resouce hungry. It can be made to look exceptionally good looking, and yet be powerful. If tiling is not your cup of tea (or if you can do with the ShellShape plugin for GNOME shell), try GNOME 3 (Yes, you Ubuntu users still stuck on Unity, you too).
